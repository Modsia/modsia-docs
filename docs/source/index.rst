Modsia: Modular Desktop Speech Interaction Architecture

The **Modsia** project aims to provide a comprehensive architecture and platform for speech
interaction on common Linux desktop environments.

The project both defines an extensible
architecture for suporting voice input and provides a minimal reference implementation of each of
the key components of that architecure.

Documentation about the project can be found at `modsia.io <https://modsia.io/>`_. The project code
is currently developed at our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Modsia>`_.
