The Skills Interpreter
======================

This is a stub page.

Typically template-based. Templates may have tagged parts of speech missing that will be matched
in the input and included in the command.

Actions can either involve running an external executable or making a number of D-Bus calls.

Potentially can be used stand-alone as a NLP command interface.

Since this runs other code, security needs to be considered.
